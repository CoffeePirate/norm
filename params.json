You'll be surprised how much software you can install this way.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nAdding new package:\r\n\r\n * Create a file in `packages` directory.\r\n * Add `fetch_source` line first.\r\n * Add `depends_on` lines if neccessary.\r\n * Add `do_unpack_compile` line.\r\n\r\nFor examples, see existing packages.\r\n\r\nSince the variability of systems the code will be built on is big, please make sure build process doesn't depend on anything but system's gcc/binutils and system's glibc. Every other dependency should be brought with you.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
