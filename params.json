{"name":"NORM","tagline":"You donâ€™t need root to install anything","body":"#NORM = NOt Root (package) Manager\r\n\r\nEasy way to install software when you don't have root and can only write to your home directory. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```bash\r\nnorm install gcc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis installs gcc to `$HOME/norm/bin/gcc` by downloading source and compiling gcc and it's dependencies. After that, add $HOME/norm/bin to your PATH and you can use your shiny new gcc.\r\n\r\nYou'll be surprised how much software you can install this way.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##Adding new package\r\n\r\n * Create a file in `packages` directory.\r\n * Add `fetch_source` line first.\r\n * Add `depends_on` lines if neccessary.\r\n * Add `do_unpack_compile` line.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\ndepends_on libacl libattr\r\n\r\nfetch_source http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/tar/tar-1.28.tar.gz cd30a13bbfefb54b17e039be7c43d2592dd3d5d0\r\ndo_unpack_compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more examples, see existing packages.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nSince the variability of systems the code will be built on is big, please try to bring every dependency with the package, except for glibc, gcc and binutils.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, don't build with rarely used features (like kerberos in openssh or ldap in curl).\r\n","google":"UA-50765688-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
